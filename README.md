# Memra

"Memra" is an Aramaic term, denoting to "word".

This is to be a repo for structuring traits of religious texts, particularly Abrahamic religions, to the purpose of building open standards for data persistence and discovery.

The last of Abrahamic religions i.e. Islam had its final of prophetic traditions taking place 1390 years back. That is well over millennia, and fairly long since the major compilations were made through scholarly research work. Prior religions naturally had a lot of world history already created by the time of advent of Islam.

With the maturation of internet, digitization of information and world events, various models of data storage, and their governance, this is a high time to creating open standards for accessibility of traditional religious texts that majority humanity subscribes to, irrespective of the frequency of their real world application.

## Background

Abrahamic religions have shared generic qualities, especially a nature of versioning, in engineering terms, each has degrees of backward compatibility. Within each, there are sections of belief, that can be thought of as forks, with a base layer: A collection of divine words, propagated by a physical entity, documented by witnesses.

Then there are translations, philosophy of interpretation, and words that build on top of those words, and words that document the deeds of the propagating entity and of their time of physical existence.

## Research

Internet protocols have advanced from basic 5-7 layer models, they are now beyond hierarchical. On top of low-level communication protocols, decades of research has created stable graph-based structures that now open use cases of richer data linking, complex relations, their querying, indexing, and versatility in effective persistence.

Focus should be to leverage these advancements in favor of replication and preservation of historic texts, and this effort will focus on applications to texts that are a subject of majority world population.

The outcome should be ease and efficiency of categorical and contextual search. The quality could be further improved by tagging systems, making timeframe another dimension of search and analysis.

Beyond early thoughts and some readings of original texts, next steps are literature review in relation to data analyses done on subjects, existing specialized protocols if any, current forms of presentation, open literary and linguistic datasets etc. Followed by approach to scholars to build on top base knowledge, and institutions that maintain current databases.

Surely with our subject, the major challenge still not overcome, is digitization and systems for validations of original religious texts. Moving forward, a discourse must be created on this front as well.
